                        <h2>Olympic Weightlifting</h2>
                        <p>Olympic weightlifting, or olympic style weightlifting is a barbell sport consisting of two lifts; the snatch, and the clean and jerk. In competition, weightlifters are placed into specific weight categories. For each lift, each athlete will have 3 attempts and the winner of the weight category is decided based on the highest kilogram total of the competition lifts. A lifter who fails all 3 attempts for the cleand and jerk or snatch, is said to fail to <i>total</i>. Therefore, the athlete receives an <i>incomplete</i> entry and cannot medal for the competition.</p>
